    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to evaluate your team members' risk and reward profiles for a scenario you are all familiar with: studying for tests in school. Imagine that you and your partner(s) are getting ready for a big test in your most/least favorite class. We want to compare your tolerances for risk when preparing for this test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A: What type of test is your team considering?\n",
    "\n",
    "When told, take a moment and discuss with your team which test you will be considering here. Agree on a class, a teacher, and the material that would be on this test. This could be a test you all took recently, or a final you all remember being particularly difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B: What are the answers to your \"lottery questions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your \"test\" details are decided, we need to consider the lottery questions to answer. Here, the questions are posed as **certainty equivalence lottery questions**: they pose a choice between a lottery (a chance at a good and bad outcome) or a certainty event (you get a third outcome for sure).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this scenario, we will consider choices between:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  a *lottery* where there is a probability $p$ of getting a 100% on the test and a probability $1-p$ of getting a 40% on the test, and\n",
    "-  a *certainty* of getting a score $X$, as if the teacher agreed that this score matches what they would expect.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Task:** For each of four such decisions, determine what certain score, $X$, would make the decision between the lottery and the certain score a toss up: both options seem about equal to you. The four decisions are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1) A 20% chance at a 100%, and a 80% chance at a 40%, or a score of $X$.\n",
    "- 2) A 40% chance at a 100%, and a 60% chance at a 40%, or a score of $X$.\n",
    "- 3) A 60% chance at a 100%, and a 40% chance at a 40%, or a score of $X$.\n",
    "- 4) A 80% chance at a 100%, and a 20% chance at a 40%, or a score of $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "On your index card, write numbers (1) through (4) down, and for each decision above, write the certain score of $X$ on the test that would make each option about equal in preference. DO NOT DISCUSS YOUR ANSWERS WITH YOUR PARTNER(S), this is an individual decision and there are no wrong answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C: Input your responses below and compare your value and risk profiles to your partner(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell below, replace 'MyNameHere' with one of your partner(s) names, and put their responses to the lottery questions in order in the \"response\" row below that name. Repeat for each of your partners for Name1 - Name4. If you need help, ask!"
